# Melting Polar Ice Could Affect Timekeeping, Study Says
### A recent study discovered that the loss of ice due to climate change is leading to a redistribution of mass on Earth significant enough to modify its rotational dynamics.

From data analysis, here are **my findings**:

- The North Pole ice area has decreased by 46% since 1983. In 2011, a historically low ice area was observed, with only about 43 km² recorded.
- The South Pole ice area has decreased by 33% since 1979. Last year, the ice area hit a record low at approximately 61.2 km².
- The North Pole sea ice extent decreases by an average of 3.7% annually from 1978 to 2023. In December 1979, the sea ice extent decreased by nearly 26%. In 2023, it saw a loss of around 3.4%.
- In the South Pole, situation seems to be much more positive. Through out 1978 to 2023, there was an increase in percentage of ice average extent in most years, though a huge drop in 1979.

**Data Collection**:
NASA.

**Data Analysis**:
I created several tabels with the columns I want from the big datasets, and used **Pandas** to read the CSV files. Then I used **ggplot** to create basic charts and visualizations, save them into pdf, and edit the charts in **Adobe Illustrator**. Employing the technique of **ai2html**, I made these charts responsive to the size of screen and inserted them into HTML.

**New Learnings**:
I exercised my skills of using ggplot and editing charts in AI, and first time tried ai2html.
